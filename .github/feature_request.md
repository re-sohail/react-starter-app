## Business Case

As a developer, I want to enhance the React starter app to be more suitable for production-level applications. This will help in creating a more robust, scalable, and maintainable codebase that can be used for real-world projects.

## Proposed Solution

1. **Implement Authentication**: Add user authentication using JWT tokens and integrate with a backend service.
2. **State Management**: Integrate Redux for state management to handle complex state logic.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement global error handling using `react-error-boundary`.
4. **SEO Optimization**: Use `react-helmet-async` for managing meta tags and improving SEO.
5. **Testing**: Add unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Enhance the existing CI/CD pipeline to include automated tests and deployment to a staging environment.
7. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the app for performance using code splitting and lazy loading.
8. **Accessibility**: Ensure the app is accessible and meets ADA compliance standards.

## Alternatives Considered

1. Using Context API instead of Redux for state management.
2. Using a different testing framework like Mocha or Jasmine.
3. Using server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js instead of client-side rendering with React.

## Additional Context

- The app is currently using Vite for bundling and development server.
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling.
- The app is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages.
- The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.
