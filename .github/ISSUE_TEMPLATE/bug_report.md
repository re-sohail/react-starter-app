- OS: macOS Ventura
- Device: MacBook Air 2017
- Network: WiFi

## Current Behavior

When navigating to the HomePage, the app crashes with the error message: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined".

## Expected Behavior

The HomePage should load without errors and display the list of items fetched from the API.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Start the app using `npm run dev`.
2. Open the browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
3. Observe the error message in the console and the app crash.

## Possible Solution

The issue might be due to the API response not being handled correctly. Adding a check to ensure the data is defined before calling `map` might fix the issue.
